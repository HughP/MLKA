#What is the problem?

##Can we compare ease of text input across languages?

###If yes, can we make a determination of if shorter - easier languages are the ones in which communication happens?

###If no, Why not?
Are current metrics for establishing fitness sufficient for measuring languages with diacritics?

The mixing of digital communications technologies and multilingual environments have created new language choice options for device users. For instance () discuss the nature of English use by Arabic speaking persons. _()_ leave the reason for code switching open. That is, It might be because the Arabic language does not have vocabulary for these kinds of ideas, or it might be because there is no social space for this kind of discourse in Arabic, or thirdly it might be because of the technology. Following up on this third idea, that technology is influencing language choice we might ask the several questions, like _how_, or _why_ or _to what extent_ is the technology an influential factor. Currently no method exists to comprehensively access the influence of a technology on langauge use situation. It would be a fool's errand to attempt in this thesis to present much less prove such a method. However, what is much more feasible is an assesment of a keyboard layout. That is, if a technology user has two options (language A and language B) to input a text, which text input option is more likely to be used, and on what basis can we make this suggestion?

One method to measure the likelyhood that a particualr text input method will be perfered is to measure the work required to encode a message using a particualar text input method. Theroies of -(language entropy)_ suggest that ___ and _(theories of fitts law)_ suggest that humans look for the shortest possible route to communicate a message.

Michael Dickenson author of optimizer looks at the following factors:

	distance
	inRoll
	outRoll
	sameHand
	sameFingerP
	sameFingerR
	sameFingerM
	sameFingerI
	rowChangeUp
	rowChangeDown
	handWarp
	handSmooth
	homeJump
	homeJumpIndex
	doubleJump
	toCenter
	toOutside

and gives the fingers the following scores:
