###Consonants
In summary the Navajo orthography contains the following "character sequences" and their representative phonemes:

|     Consonants     |   |   |     |     |   |    |    |   |    |     |    |    |    |    |    |    |   |   |   |   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    | 
|:-----------------:|---|---|-----|-----|---|----|----|---|----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|     Orthography   | ' | b | ch  | ch' | d | dl | dz | g | gh | h   | hw | j  | k  | k' | kw  | l | ɬ | m | n | s | sh  | t  | t' | tɬ | tɬ' | ts | ts' | w | x | y | z | zh |
| Phonetic Notation | ʔ | p | tʃʰ | tʃʼ | t | tˡ | ts | k | ɣ  | h/x | xʷ | tʃ | kx | k' | kxʷ | l | ɬ | m | n | s | ʃ | tx | t' | tɬʰ | tɬʼ | tsʰ | tsʼ | w |  | j | z | ʒ |

In the above chart orthography "character sequences" or digraphs are shown relative to the phonemes they represent. In the following chart the typographical characters presented:

| Orthography characters |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|:----------:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upper Case | ' | B | C | D | G | H | J | K | L | Ł | M | N | S | T | W | X | Y | Z |
| Lower Case | ' | b | c | d | g | h | j | k | l | ɬ | M | N | s | t | w | x | y | z |

However, like many other languages which operate in bilingual contexts other typographical characters are sometimes used. For instance ⟨ V,v ⟩ is used in the term _Navajo_, and ⟨ U,u ⟩ is used in the term _Jesus_. Both of these terms are non-native terms and could be considered borrowings. Holm also notes the presence of borrowed graphemes in Navajo texts (1971:5). Specifically Holm mentions ⟨ F,f; P,p; Q,q; R,r; V,v ⟩. Holm further suggests that these borrowed graphemes should be a included in the education curriculum in Navajo schools because these graphemes are used to spell borrowed words which are in common use. For our purposes, in the analysis of typing, we should be prepared to include borrowed graphemes because they are in part of the common communication system used by Navajo language users. We can see in the cases of the touch screen keyboard layouts that in fact ⟨ U,u ⟩ is added to the keyboard, but other characters like ⟨ V,v ⟩ are left off the keyboard. There are two possible non-exclusive interpretations for leaving borrowed graphemes on the mobile text entry solution: (1) certain designers prioritize some borrowed graphemes over others, (2) that some graphemes are left on the keyboard as residue based on the QWERTY design template used to create the Navajo text input layout.

####Multi-width functional units (series of typographical characters which represent a single functional unit)
A list of multi-graph consonants is provided to be consistent with the discussion of vowels provided later. 

* ⟨ ch, ch', dl, dz, gh, hw, k', kw, t', tɬ, tɬ', ts, ts', zh ⟩


###Vowels

| Orthography characters |   |   |   |   |
|:----------:|---|---|---|---|
| Upper Case | A | E | I | O |
| Lower Case | a | e | i | o |

####Length
Vowels may be long or short. Long vowels are indicated twice orthographically i.e. ⟨ aa ⟩.


####Tone
There are two pitch heights in Navajo, high and low. Low tone is unmarked. High tone is marked with an acute accent. Tone may occur on vowels or nasals. Typically tone is not indicated on ⟨ m ⟩, when it occurs on ⟨ n ⟩ it appears as ⟨ ń ⟩.

####Tone Patterns (Melodies)
Based on orthographic marking four kinds of tonal patterns which occur on Navajo tone bearing units. McDonough (1999:510) claims that the syllable is the tone bearing unit. Further analysis would be needed to look at the word melodies, or tone patterns across the stem of Navajo words. The tone patterns as they exist orthographically are presented in the chart below:

| *Tonal Patterns in Navajo* | Single and long Vowels | Long Vowels |
|:------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|
| High                     |       H      |     HL (Falling)    |
| Low                      |       L      |     LH (Rising)     |

Orthographically the following occur:H, L, LL, HH, LH (Rising), HL (Falling). HH, HL and LL, LH sequences only occur on long vowels.
For further considerations of Navajo tone, including lexical vs. grammatical tone, toneless prefixes, and tonal interactions consider:

* McDonough, Joyce M. 1999. Tone in Navajo. Anthropological Linguistics 41.4: 503-40. http://www.jstor.org/stable/30028725

#####Classification of tonal orthographic marking
Following Roberts (2009:143) the Navajo tonal orthography would be a case of "exhaustive" tone marking because it is less than one tone mark per pitch level in the language. Roberts points out that others have called this "minimal" marking. Reasons for his change in terminology are well presented and the reader hear is encouraged to read Robert's arguments.

The relevance of visual crowding to the text input experience is laid out as follows. Often visual crowding is related to an increased (compared to English) use of diacritics in the orthography. Efforts to reduce visual crowding often involve revising the orthography of a language. However, _easy-to-read_ (visual crowding) and _easy-to-type_ can be closely or distally related based on a variety of factors. However, in academic literature it appears that visual crowding is blamed as a motivator for orthography reform even when user motivations for revising writing technologies may be more inline with desiring an easier text input method. That is, orthography system users conflate the  _easy-to-read_ and _easy-to-type_ (_easy-to-write_) categories into a single category. A category something like _easy-to-use_. Orthography users then subconsciously compare this conflated category to how they perceive other orthographies working. Commonly, with the globalization of English, the comparison is with English.

####Nasality
Vowels may be produced with with nasal resonation. Nasality is indicated with an [ogonek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogonek) ⟨ ˛ ⟩ mark below the vowel. Typographically this mark appears in the center of the character (as apposed to the European style of having the mark appear to the right edge of the character).

####Diphthongs
Diphthongs occur and are indicated as a sequence of contrasting orthographical vowels. Some editions of resources by Young and Morgan (1972, 1987) suggest that there are long diphthongs. These would be diphthongs where the second vowel would be longer than the first and are indicated in the orthography as trigraphs. The graphemic frequency counts of Holm (1971: 22-25) support the presence of trigraphs in Navajo texts. There are quite a few diphthongs presented across these resources. However, the main Navajo diphthongs are as follows ⟨ ai, ao, ei, oi, io ⟩. For further discussion of diphthongs see Holm (1971:8) and Young and Morgan (1972: I-VI, 1987: xii-xiii)

###Diacritics
There are two diacritics used in the orthography. Both diacritics are used in combination with vowels. One diacritic may be used with nasals. Vowels are optionally marked for nasality with an [ogonek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogonek) ⟨ ˛ ⟩ mark below the vowel. Vowel and nasal base characters may appear with an [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent) ⟨ ´ ⟩ indicating high tone on the vowel or nasal. Vowels are also repeated typographically when they are contrastive for length.

Since Navajo uses a four vowel system (at least by orthographic base character), the use of diacritics creates the following permutations.  

####Single width typographical characters
* ⟨ a, á, ą, ą́, e, é, ę, ę́, i, í, į, į́, o, ó, ǫ, ǫ́, n, ń ⟩

####Multi-width typographical characters

* ⟨ aa, áa, aá, áá, ąą, ą́ą, ąą́, ą́ą́ ⟩
* ⟨ ee, ée, eé, éé, ęę, ę́ę, ęę́, ę́ę́ ⟩
* ⟨ ii, íi, ií, íí, įį, į́į, įį́, į́į́ ⟩
* ⟨ oo, óo, oó, óó, ǫǫ, ǫ́ǫ, ǫǫ́, ǫ́ǫ́ ⟩

When vowel length (duration) is considered as a factor for creating permutations, the multi-width combinations should also be considered. That is, these permutations represent what is argued to phonologically be a single phoneme in Navajo. The above permutations could all be considered "letters" if one holds two things to be true:

1. one holds that a "letter" is a graphical representations of a phoneme,
2. one also holds that tonemes are inherently bound to their co-articulated phoneme (something like a structuralist view on tone rather than an auto-segmental view).

However, as typographical characters these permutations range from digraphs to hexagraphs. The literature consulted on Navajo is unclear as how these sequences are taught to users of the Navajo language. Some resources such as Young and Morgan (1972) do discuss multi-graphs independently. Therefore it is possible that native speakers consider the previous examples, or the following examples as single "letters". The issue of multi-graphs in Navajo reading is acknowledged in Holme's work (1971) where he provides special statistical counts for multi-graphs. Holm's work is couched in a longitudinal study of Navajo literacy and education. The statistics were part of ground work towards creating literacy materials in Navajo. Naturally, these issues spill over into the implementation of writing systems in digital mediums.

Therefore the impact of multi-graphs on typing is also important. Part of the typing process is the immediate reading of the typed text. `__(expand)__`  And the looming question comes to: _Should a text input system be designed to match the functional units in the specified language?_  Some argue that writing and speech are completely unrelated in their products.  Roberts (2009: §2.4) discusses in some detail the variation which exists in how readers perceive characters with diacritics - including the possibilities raised by Huckauf et al. (1999) that characters with various components become consolidated in the minds of experience readers.

###Punctuation
Punctuation is discussed briefly by Channessian (1969:7) in a report on the conference on Navajo orthography. An English like practice is reported to be in use in Navajo texts. The exception being the use of quote marks. Navajo opts for French style guillemets ⟨ « , » , ‹ , › ⟩ so as to not confuse quote marks with glottal stop marks which use an apostrophe.

##Keyboard Layout

There are several text input solutions which are used to create digital written texts in Navajo. Four are briefly discussed here. These four solutions include two different full size keyboard layouts, and two layouts on mobile devices, one each for iOS and Android. 

The first of the two full size keyboard layouts discussed was developed prior to Unicode. It was utilized along with a customized font. Keys on the keyboard were assigned on the basis of which characters in the font were replaced. I assume that numbers were also chosen as a design process to maximize the retention of accurate characters on the keyboard. Letters like "Y,y" were not moved because they already matched the given keyboard layout. However, characters like "U,u" were not replaced. I assume that this was because "U,u" was needed in contexts where the person was also writing in English. We can see evidence of this historical language artifact in the online work at: http://www.gomyson.com/traces.php

![Pre-Unicode Keyboard](/Publications/2015%20-%20Thesis/Data%20Used/1.%20USA%20Use%20Case/O.%20Navajo%20Text%20Sample/Navajo-Keyboards/images/NAV-keyboard.jpg)

In this pre-Unicode keyboard, layout each of the vowel permutations is treated with a separate key (with the exception of long vowels). High toned n ⟨ ń ⟩, bared l ⟨ ɬ ⟩, and the glottal stop marker all receive their own keys as well.

This keyboard also focuses on matching keystrokes to typographical units. For instance one key is designated for each of the following ⟨ a, á, ą, ą́ ⟩. Long vowels still require double taps of the keys. This keyboard layout does not show symmetry between phonemes and keystrokes, but does show symmetry between keystrokes and typographical units.

The second keyboard layout as I understand it, [is the work of Chris Harvey](http://www.languagegeek.com/dene/dine/dine_bizaad.html). Harvey created the keyboard to work with and use Unicode characters. In the process optimizing some of the required keys around the Unicode characters. For instance, combining diacritics. This keyboard layout in essence creates a modifier key for tone marks and nasalization marks. This is where a vowel or nasal key is pressed and then immediately following key press would add a modifier diacritic like the acute accent or ogonek. It is important to note that this keyboard is still optimized around characters -- Unicode characters, rather than orthographic typographic characters. A specific description of Harvey's keyboard layout can be found here: Description: http://www.languagegeek.com/dene/keyboards/Keymaps/Navajo.pdf

A visual comparison of the two keyboard layouts is below.

![Both Keyboards](/Publications/2015%20-%20Thesis/Data%20Used/1.%20USA%20Use%20Case/O.%20Navajo%20Text%20Sample/Navajo-Keyboards/images/799px-KB_USA-Navajo.svg.png)

Image of both keyboards is sourced [from Wikipedia](https://sco.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_leid).


A third set of text input solutions were created to meet demands created by the proliferation of mobile communication devices. Jerome Tsosie, president and founder of Native Innovations Inc. is credited with the design and production of the keyboard apps in the Android Market and the [iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navajo-keyboard/id577841547?mt=8) for Navajo language use. These keyboards are interesting and important to mention for several reasons. 
The first reason is that Android and iOS devices are increasing in popularity globally among minority language using populations. Specifically, Jerome Tsosie, the designer of the keyboards on these touch screen devices, recognizes the use of mobile devices as particularly popular and important among Navajo language users (Jung 2013). Due to the proliferation of personal communication devices, it is likely that there are more people sending messages in Navajo text than ever before because there are more people with access to text input solutions.
The second reason that these keyboards are important is that if we look at the design philosophy behind these mobile keyboards. The mobile keyboards mimic the design elements of the pre-Unicode keyboard. That is rather than treating tone and nasal diacritics as an "add-on" typographical unit, the single key creates a complete typographical unit inclusive of diacritics. While this arrangement of keys and ease of access to pre-formed typographical character combinations can have an impact on ease of use for typing Navajo, it does not mean that it accurately reflects how the diacritics are taught in the classroom. However, moving forward if access to the characters is combined, so that pre-formed combinations are what device users continually interact with, then it follows that eventually some users will likely see these characters as single units based on access methodology. Note that this is different than the other psychological affect that Huckauf et al. (1999) point to in experienced readers. That is, experienced readers often begin to see complex characters as single units.
The third reason to look at the keyboards on these devices is because it shows the impact and relationship between the keyboard layout design used in desktop designed the keyboard layout designs which appear on touch screens. If we were to measure just one keyboard for Navajo it would make sense to measure the one which is likely the most popularly used text input solution.

##Stats from the book of James

The goal in processing the book of James is to determine how much "work" is conducted in the typing of this particular text segment. In order to make an assessment several things are assumed (1) the text is valid Navajo language, (2) that the text is representative of the Navajo language text input needs, (3) that the text was input correctly when it was typed, and (4) that the text can give some residue of the way it was typed.
To ensure that the text processed is Navajo language the text of the book of James was copied from the following publication found online:

* American Bible Society. 2000. James. Navajo Bible. American Bible Society. https://www.bible.com/versions/1098

Various characters were removed from the source text. These included section headings, chapter markers, and verse markers. The purpose in doing this was to make the text as equatable as possible with other translations of the book of James used in this study. That is, several copies in this study did not have section headings, so, the texts were massaged to eliminate obvious incongruities.
In order to test assumption two the text of the Navajo Wikipedia was processed in parallel to this text. A short comparison based on frequencies of characters is provided later.
Assumption three is taken in good faith. Only live tests, with human subjects could show otherwise. Using corpora of written text is acceptable, though not preferred in similar UX and text input studies.
Assumption four is a bit more challenging to address. Several methods of counting characters were used to count characters in each text. Initial counts used [UnicodeCCount](http://scripts.sil.org/UnicodeCharacterCount), a perl script by Bob Hallissy.
As has already been discussed, characters may be input via an orthographical typographical unit form (i.e. first keyboard), or they may be divided up into Unicode Character form (i.e. second keyboard). This only need affect how the text input buttons are arranged when the user perceives them. Background processes to the text input process may choose to actually store the data in various encoded formats - even if all of those formats are Unicode. Specifically, of concern in this case is canonical equivalence. UnicodeCCount has the capability to provide counts in several ways: 
* _No flags_ - defaults to UTF-8
* _-m_ displays output in _combining mark sequences_ where (base + diacritics) are counted separately.
* _-u_ uses the Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) rather than the default sort. 
* _-c_ or _-d_ enforce Unicode normalization (NFC or NFD) as data is read.

All of the above options are used and noted in various parts of this study. By decomposing characters and counting them it is then possible to reconstruct the keys used to produce the text corpus being analyzed. Once the text corpus is analyzed by keyboard input method, it is then possible to determine the following:

* A heat map visualization for the sample text from James.
* A heat map visualization of the entire text from James.
* A fitness score for each keyboard. Based on James, and again based on the Wikipedia corpus. This fitness score includes:
 * Total number of keystrokes with the current layout
 * right hand v.s. left hand (I started an interesting calculator in Google Docs.)
 * finger load per finger 0-9
 * right - left balance
 * use of punctuation
 * Characters not used in the text
 * Percentage of use
 * Combinational use of characters
 * distance traveled

###Text Counts
The original text capture from the _Navajo Bible_ can be found in the following file: [`/Navajo James Text/Navajo Text.txt`](/Publications/2015%20-%20Thesis/Data%20Used/1.%20USA%20Use%20Case/O.%20Navajo%20Text%20Sample/Navajo%20James%20Text/Navajo%20Text.txt)
As previously indicated, the file was cleaned up for this study. The file used for statistics is the following: [`/Navajo James Text/Navajo Text-no numbers-no headings.txt`](/Publications/2015%20-%20Thesis/Data%20Used/1.%20USA%20Use%20Case/O.%20Navajo%20Text%20Sample/Navajo%20James%20Text/Navajo%20Text-no%20numbers-no%20headings.txt)
When referring to "the James text", it is this second file which will be referenced.

In the James text the following statistics are encountered.

Question|Note|Statistic|
---|---|---|---
How many words are in the text?| _This was determined by counting the number of spaces and adding 1._| 2,047
How many characters are in the text?| _This was determined by counting using -u. This number includes white spaces and non-displaying characters, but not all characters are fully decomposed._| 16,488
How many fully decomposed characters are in the text?| _This was determined by counting using -d. This number includes white spaces and non-displaying characters._| 19,931
How many visible decomposed characters are in the text?| _This was determined by counting using -d and excluding 'U+0020' SPACE and 'U+000A' LINEFEED._ |17,322 
How many visible orthographic units, counting long vowels as one unit, are in the text?| _This was determined by counting the total number of characters, subtracting invisible characters, subtracting the diacritics, and then also subtracting the number of occurrences of long vowels._| 
What is the Tonal Marking Density of the text?| _This was determined by counting the total number of potential tone bearing units and dividing that by the total number of high tone marks. Tone bearing units are counted as phonemes. Since long vowels with high tone take two orthographic diacritics to mark tone, two counts are given to long vowels even though they represent a single phoneme. (This is similar to total diacritic marking density, but only looks at tone.)_ | 
What is the Total Diacritic Density of the text?| _This is the total number of diacritics which are used compared with the total options in the text via the orthography for diacritics._ |
