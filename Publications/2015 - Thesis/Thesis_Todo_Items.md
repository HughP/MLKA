Section 2.3.2 
 There are two SUM citations in Endnote for section 2.3.2 see if these need removed from this section or if this section needs additional text added

Section 2.3.3
 There are three citations in Endnote about citation metrics which have not been used. My inclination is to not use them as this is not the main thrust of the section and is already well supported.

 Consider David Weber’s comment about Oral traditions and Literacy
Keyboard layout is only important if writing is important, and the importance of writing hinges on the creation of a literature --literature that grips people, that is vital to survival, that gives spiritual and intellectual life. But you have to face the growing number of people who think that literacy undercuts oral literature.  So there could be some interesting and relevant discussion.
