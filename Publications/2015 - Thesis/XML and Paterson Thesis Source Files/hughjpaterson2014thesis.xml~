>Keyboard layout design affects language vitality. Socio-technical systems are increasingly important in today’s communication ecology (Whitworth &amp; Ahmad 2013). Language development projects and language planing programs need a way to integrate linguistic knowledge, information, and transmission practices into socio-technical systems if the languages used in these systems are going to be the mother tongue languages of minority language speakers. With the current rate of technological adaption it is more than feasible that technical systems (such as social media and the mobile devices used to access these systems) will become more relevant than the traditional, printed, literacy reading primer (Blench 2012: 15). This requires addressing the design tension between requirements for minority language users and the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) requirements of computing devices. The academic linguistic community often attempts to address these tensions at the orthography “design” level (Cooper 2005: 160, Jany 2010b: 235-6). However these “solutions” often revolve around removing diacritic marks from Roman script orthographies (Boerger 2007: 134) and do not address the marking of tone in languages, such as Chinantec (Foris 2000) and some African languages (Roberts 2011), where there is a significant need to mark tone. Such solutions also do not affect key frequency issues, or diacritic marks in Ajami and Indic scripts. This project focuses on the arrangement of keys on the keyboard, or keyboard layout (KL); proposing that KL’s are the cornerstone to truly adapting the digital content creation process to the needs of minority language users. In the context of minority language text input design specifications and considerations, there has been relatively little published, either for the publishing industry, linguists, or for technologists (designers and programers). The one exception is an unfinished book released in draft form by SIL’s foundry NRSI (Lyons 2001). In contrast to the relatively sparse literature specifically supporting and covering minority language text input, QWERTY keyboard interactions, primarily dealing with English, are well studied (MacKenzie 2002, 2007, 2013, MacKenzie &amp; Tanaka-Ishii 2007). This current study takes current practice in the HCI literature and applies it to several minority language use cases, focusing on languages which use diacritics, often as a device used to explicitly mark tone in their orthographies.</p

>In communicative environments where there is the option to use more than one language, choice of language is based in both social and physical environments. Orthography design decisions are often perceived to have an effect on the mechanics of language expression in digital mediums. However, strictly speaking it is only the text input method not the orthography which plays a role in the mechanics of creating new entextualized content in digital mediums. Emotional responses to physical elements of a language such as the design of orthography, the computer operating system, and of the text input method bear upon the language user. In the disciplines of language documentation and language description, text input methods may initially be developed with the needs of the researcher in mind rather than the needs of a native speaker who uses the language in everyday interactions. These existing keyboard layouts that support specific languages,which are created by researchers, are rarely used by the broader minority language community, and the efficacy of these keyboard layouts is limited to linguistic analysis or researcher convenience. Linguists often bring linguistic knowledge and some of their own expectations as ‘experienced’ computer users to the keyboard design process. They may not realize that requiring a typist to negotiate a keyboard layout to access a given character (often a non-ASCII character) can have an impact on language-use choice, the development path of an orthography, or adherence to an approved orthography. User-centric keyboard layout design for minority language community writers/typists should be an integral part of a language development project in the twenty-first century. These considerations bring us to the following question: At what point in the design process should linguistic information be considered and applied, as opposed to other design criteria, so that maximal language usage is encouraged and made possible? This study offers a framework for the linguist or language development worker to address crucial issues of keyboard layout design.</p

>There are four reasons that the mechanical process of writing and the process of typing in digital contexts (text input) is of interest to those who study languages: they are an expression of thought, a means of communication, and a reflection of brain processes. First, keyboarding is an expression of language and reveals some very unique ways that the human body expresses communicative thought. For instance, consider the ability to type ‘LOL’ without actually laughing or thinking “laugh out loud”. These typing gestures can connect with our thoughts without activating the vocal or aural mechanisms which are often employed in the encoding and decoding of communicative thought. The study of the mechanics of writing is not new. European Renaissance writers were discussing hand writing in relationship to personality, as early as the sixteenth century (Baldi 1622). More recent works focus on: the relationship between handwriting and brain processing (Askov, Otto &amp; Askov 1970, Peck, Askov &amp; Fairchild 1980), motor control (van Galen 1991), and the developmental and pedagogical change insinuated by moving from handwriting to typing as the mechanical bases of the expression of textual compositions (Christensen 2004, Stevenson &amp; Just 2012). Second, the language teacher (including second language instructor) is interested in language use in all mediums; computer-mediated communication, and oral communication. Chapelle (2003) and Jones &amp; Plass (2002) differ in how they conceptualize the integration of technology use in the language learning process. However, regardless of the theoretical approach, typing and keyboard input is an acknowledged component of the Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) environment (Strik 2012: 9) if nothing else but to facilitate other more salient aspects of learning theory activities. More specifically though Lally (2000) and Sturm (2006) argue that keyboarding and typing does effect the way that language learners recall the use of diacritics on words.The third reason that typing (text input) is of interest to those who study language is that the psychologist and linguist are interested in how the brain processes language through the process of writing, which includes typing (text input). This thesis will touch on various aspects of these three points as it proposes a framework for keyboard layout design. The fourth reason that is text input is important to those who study language is that is is important in the language development movement. That is, as more and more minority language using communities approach the task of language development they often reach out to those who study languages (linguists) for help. As Lally (2000) and Sturm (2006) argue that keyboarding affect the way that language learners remember characters, it seems logical then that for learners of languages, even if they are native speakers, or heritage learners would be subject to the same impacts of typing on the way they learn the written form of the language they are using. This is an important point which needs to be worked into language development practices by those involved in language development activities like orthography development which in some sense can be a sub-component of text input development or writing development. In particular, diacritics and their use in orthographies become important since it is estimated that between 60-70 percent of languages are tonal (Yip 2002: 1) and diacritics are the primary way orthographies indicate tone.</p

>Keyboard layout design is intrinsically interdisciplinary. To create a tool for language use which not only works but is embraced by a group of users requires an understanding of linguistic knowledge, script knowledge, and digital technology knowledge germane to the language entextulization challenge. For a new keyboard layout (analyzed as an object) to be embraced by a user group requires a successful application of principles from economics, anthropology, and design, especially user experience design. That is, people must be able to access the object, want to use the object, and finally choose to use the object.</p

>Thesis layout</secTitle
><p
>Chapter one of the thesis provides a brief introduction to the topic of keyboard layouts. It presents the relevance of the study of text input to linguistics. It also provides an overview of the various chapters in the thesis and a discussion of key concepts and terms used throughout the thesis.</p
><p
>Chapter two of this thesis takes the reader through the relevance of writing to the disciplines of linguistics and language development. It is often within this context that new keyboard layouts are created for monitory languages. The first section discusses entextulization and the process often followed in developing writing for the purposes of linguistic research, language documentation and language development. These settings are not without conflicting views surrounding writing as a part of language development. Just as writing is affected by various social practices and communal attitudes towards writing, so also the process of typing (text input) is affected by similar social constraints. That is, the need for writing, and therefore also the need for text input, is not felt ubiquitously.</p
><p
>Included in chapter two is an introduction to writing and discussion of the current literature relevant to human computer interaction (HCI) and keyboard interaction analysis. Academically, user experience design falls under the broader discipline of computer science, therefore much of the literature discussing text input (even in minority languages) does not occur in the linguistics or language documentation literature. Current literature concerning keyboard layout design, while not solely based on English language text input, is predominantly based on English language research. Furthermore, this research is rarely cited and apparently un-accessed by language development staff in the production of keyboard layouts (p.c. with various keyboard layout designers). For these language development staff a far more pressing goal is the correct typesetting of professional documents, therefore the keyboard layout becomes a way to limit (or quality control) data input options for text processing systems<endnote

>The creation of keyboard layouts and text input systems is sometimes delegated to publishers (and typesetters and their foundries). These stakeholders in the publishing process are very interested in consistent encoding of texts. As an example some packages of LaTeX require the special declaration of combining glyphs to form characters and can not accept strait unicode characters (Goossens, Rahtz &amp; Mittelbach 1997: 264-5). This more restricted approach to text input can be seen as a challenge for self publishers, who prefer a more straightforward approach to entextualization.</p
></endnote
>. It is the goal of this thesis to integrate HCI and language development literatures so that the language development professional has a resource which references both literatures and provides that person with a framework upon which to design future keyboard layouts. Figure 1 is a visualization of the various topics discussed in this thesis and their inter-relatedness. It attempts to layout the topical landscape on two clines: the community internal - external cline (right and left sides), and the issues affecting the desire and capability of a community to engage in the act of writing (top and bottom). Connecting the various topics are several classes of lines which generally show some sort of association, though the association is not always the same in every language’s situation. Heavier lines generally show more relatedness, while dotted lines show an amorphous relationship. Arrows generally show direction of impact when a directionality is determinable.</p
><p
>Chapters three and four of this thesis present a comparative study of the alleged typing experience in fifteen languages. Thirteen of these languages use the Latin script (also know as the Roman script), and two of these languages use the cyrillic script. The Latin script based languages contain a variety of diacritics, and diacritic use frequencies. The Book of James is used as a corpus to derive keystrokes. These keystrokes and their frequencies are then compared and used to make suggestions for keyboard layout designs.</p
><p
>Chapter five highlights some outstanding issues in keyboard layout design in terms of theory, technology, and practical application of language related knowledge to the keyboard layout design process.</p
><p
>Back matter: It is hoped that the reader finds the interdisciplinary bibliography useful. It covers the topics user experience design, orthography design, keyboard layouts, and the sociolinguistics and sociology of writing. Following the bibliography is an appendix with a short glossary of technical terms. A second appendix with a list of the technical standards referenced in this thesis. In a third appendix, for the sake of completeness and for the benefit future researchers the analyzed texts are included in their entirety. </p

>Language Documentation versus Language Description</secTitle
><p
>Since the early 1990‘s language documentation has emerged as its own discipline (Furbee 2010, Himmelmann 1998, Woodbury 2003) growing out of the field of linguistics. One of language documentation’s distinctives is the collection of original language use performances (Nathan 2010) in digitally archivable formats (Bird &amp; Simons 2003). The focus on primary data is a shift in paradigm (Thieberger &amp; Musgrave 2007: 27-9) as much as it is in methods (Bergqvist 2012: 24). Language Documentation has focused on creating lasting and multi-purpose language artifacts, where as linguistics has traditionally chosen to focus on identifying the patterns occurring within and around language use. Along the way and facilitating the split between language documentation and linguistics, the field of linguistics has encountered two other notable movements: the endangered language movement, and the digital revolution. These movements have changed the the foundational evidence of linguistic argumentation from being an evidence based science argued from antidotal observations by linguists worried about the observers paradox (Labov 1966, 1972, 2006), and descriptions of languages based on written forms of observed of linguistic performance (for example hand transcribed Swadesh lists (Swadesh 1971: 283), to a science driven by data rich with reviewable examples of performance (Coleman 2011, Schroeter &amp; Thieberger 2011, Thieberger 2009) gathered collaboratively by speakers and researchers (Dwyer 2006: 54-6, 2010, Kuhlmann 1992: esp. 277-278, Leonard &amp; Haynes 2010, Penfield, et al. 2008).</p

>The Digital Revolution</secTitle
><p
>The first of these two movements is the Digital Revolution. The advent of socially embraced digital communication has affected the behavior of both the observed (Kiesler, Siegel &amp; McGuire 1984) and the observer (Crasborn 2010); the speaker and the listener (Seltzer, Prososki, Ziegler &amp; Pollak 2012); the writer (Porter 2003) and the reader (Fortunati &amp; Vincent 2014, Liu 2005, Mangen, Walgermo &amp; Brønnick 2013). Digital devices are reshaping the communicative context in which ‘language’ exists. Handheld radios are replacing surrogate speech forms in Chinantec [cso] society (Wilfredo Flores, pc.; Mark Sicoli in segment 23:00-23:17 in D. Duncan 2013). Research in L1/L2 and L2/L1 transference, and the role of orthographies in the production of sounds suggests that devices with text based dependencies for operation stand to have the potential to expedite the reshaping of sounds in a minority language via the graphical similarity between a minority language orthography and the orthography of a language of wider communication (Detey &amp; Nespoulous 2008, Major 2008: 69, Perre, Pattamadilok, Montant &amp; Ziegler 2009, Simon, Chambless &amp; Kickhöfel Alves 2010, Vendelin &amp; Peperkamp 2006)<endnote
id="nEnd-3"
><p
>These claims are not universally accepted. Inconclusive results are presented by Pytlyk (2007, 2011); and Pattamadilok et al. (2011: 121) while arguing for the orthographic influence on phonology point out: “… that whether orthographic knowledge affects the core mechanisms of speech processing (e.g., lexical access) or some more peripheral processes (e.g., explicit segmentation or decision/comparison) seems to depend strongly on the choice of the tasks that researchers use to probe speech processing.” For the purpose of this paper, I take this to mean that there are likely a variety of factors affecting the orthography-pronunciation relationship; of which orthography in the digital device is one.</p
></endnote
>. The change of language use(including loss) is not the only impact digital devices are having on minority languages. In some contexts minority language speakers are either adapting language use habits to incorporate the use of digital devices (Lexander 2011) or adapting their language related products (orthographies) so that it can more readily be used on existing devices (Jany 2010b: 235). Digital tools not only allow for new methods of language analysis using large multimedia corpora (Crasborn, Hulsbosch, Lampen &amp; Sloetjes 2014), but also enable people to communicate across time and space in new ways (Brinckwirth 2012, Elia 2006, Maslamani 2013). Computer and electronic device meditated communication is a reality in modern language use - both oral and written. To the 21st Century linguist this means not just studying language in its non-digital contexts, but also in its digital contexts. It also means language users no-longer have a choice between the two modalities of oral v.s written, rather there is a complex array of options available to most people which cover a plethora of communicative devices and multi-modal/multi-medium scenarios. For example, interlocutor ‘A’ may get a short email message on his computer from interlocutor ‘B’ and reply via the ‘Facebook Chat’ app via his mobile device and carry on several exchanges with interlocutor ‘B’ before walking into interlocutor ‘B’s’ office and continuing the conversation orally. All the while each segment of the conversation is constrained by the medium it occurs within. Computers have larger screens and keyboards, smart phones have smaller screens and smaller keyboards but also have oral to text features packaged with their OSes, and oral face-to-face communication usually carries with it a host of visual cues and ‘reduced’ speech forms.</p
