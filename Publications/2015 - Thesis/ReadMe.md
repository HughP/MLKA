#Thesis Folder
_There are three folders under the thesis project._

1. The thesis was written in two parts. The first sprint used Apple Pages as a composition tool and word processor. PDF backups were maintained periodically. These PDFs appear in the `` folder.
2. The second folder is the topic proposal folder. In this folder appear several versions of thesis proposal.
3. The actual thesis documents for working with XlingPaper appear in the the third folder.
