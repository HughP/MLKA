#Navajo Keyboard


As I understand the situaiton there are two keyboard layouts for Navajo. The first was developed prior to Unicode utilized a customized font. Keys were assigned on the baisis of which characters in the font were replaced. We can see evidence of this historical artifact in the online work at: http://www.gomyson.com/traces.php

The second keyboard layout as I understand it, [is the work of Chris Harvey](http://www.languagegeek.com/dene/dine/dine_bizaad.html). Chris created the keyboard to work and us Unicode characters. In the process optimizing some of the required keys around the Unicode characters. For instance, combingin diacritics. This work in essence creates a modifier key for tone marks and nasalization marks.

A third set of text input solutions were created to meet demands created by the proliforation of mobile communication devices. Jerome Tsosie, president and founder of Native Innovations Inc. is creditied with the design and production of the keyboard apps in the Android Market and the [iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navajo-keyboard/id577841547?mt=8) for Navajo language use.
