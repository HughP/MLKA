#North American Use Case
The English and Navajo languages were chosen in the North American because they by themselves represent a socio-linguistic and socio-technical observation area. Navajo is a minority language with a relatively aggressive development trajectory in digital mediums. For instance, there are mobile apps and keyboards for Navajo. These two languages were also chosen because English and Spanish could be compared as an alternative socio-technical setting to Navajo-English. Additionally, Navajo could be compared with Polish in the European context because some of the characters are the same in the two writing systems.
