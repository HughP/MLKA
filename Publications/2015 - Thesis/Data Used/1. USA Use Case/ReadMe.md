#North American Use Case
The English and Navajo languages were chosen in the North American because they by themselves represent a socio-linguistic choice. Navajo is a language with a relativly agressive development trajectory in the digital domain. There are mobile apps and keybaords for Navajo. These two languages were also chosen because English and Spanish coulc be compared as an alternitive socio-techincal setting to Navajo-English. Additionally, Navajo could be compared with Polish in the European context because some of the characters are the same in the two writing systems.
