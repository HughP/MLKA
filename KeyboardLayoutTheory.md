##Idology
_This section is for links to resources which discuss the reasons that a keyboard layout is aranged the way it is._

Perhaps the best way to start this discussion off is to layout some history.

As a rundown, there are three names which seem to come up in the computer developer side of the keyboard optimization world. These names never make it to the academic literature as far as I can tell. These names are: Michael Capewell, Michael Dickens, and David Norman. There are some other names too like: Ted Lilley, David Piepgrass. The previously mentioned names all deal with keyboard layouts. However, Bill Buxton is a real UX designer: http://www.billbuxton.com . His site is worth the quote and the time to read.
