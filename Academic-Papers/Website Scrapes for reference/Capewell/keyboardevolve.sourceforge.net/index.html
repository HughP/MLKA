<h1>Keyboard Evolve</h1>

<h2>New Version Coming Soon!</h2>

<p>Keyboard Evolve is a program that aims to develop the "best" keyboard layout.  It was inspired by <a href="http://www.visi.com/%7Epmk/evolved.html">Peter M. Klausler's experiments</a>.  To find the best layout, random layouts are generated and scored based on a set of criteria, then the best layouts are mutated and re-scored until a layout emerges as the "best layout."</p>

<p>The best layout should allow for fast typing and reduce the risk of RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury).  Ideally, it should also not be hard to learn.</p>

<p>One special characteristic of the layout I would like to generate is that the keys ZXCV should remain in the four left-most keys of the bottom row, so that Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste shortcuts are still easy to hit.</p>

<p>New features in the coming version will allow for easy definition of scoring functions, allowing anyone, even non-programmers, to come up with their own personal best layout.  This would allow people with unique typing needs to make their own layouts.  For example, a person missing a finger could make a layout that put useful keys under other fingers.</p>

<p>This project was started in mid-2005, but will be re-written from scratch in the coming months.  The old version was poorly written and difficult to extend (at the time, I was more interested in results than writing maintainable, extensible code, plus, it was my first C++ project).</p>

<h2>Old Version Still Available</h2>

<p>For the moment, this project's main web page is at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/smozoma/programming/keyboardevolve.htm">http://www.geocities.com/smozoma/programming/keyboardevolve.htm</a>.&nbsp;
Source code of this mishmash version is currently available from this
page, but eventually will only be available through SourceForge.</p>

<p>To access the sourceforgey part of the project, go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/keyboardevolve">http://sourceforge.net/projects/keyboardevolve</a>.&nbsp;
Sorry, I haven't created a source package yet in the Files
section.&nbsp; If you would like to get the source code through SVN,
see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=164159">the SVN page</a>.</p>
