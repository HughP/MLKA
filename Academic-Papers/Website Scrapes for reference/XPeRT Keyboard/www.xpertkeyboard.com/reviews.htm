<p>We decided to use XpertKeyboard to improve typing speed, over one week one of our staff members came up with the following results. <i>&quot;Initially my Qwerty (speed) was 33 wpm, averaged between 5 tests. Ending the research, my number was 68 wpm (on XPeRT), but am currently running at <b>79 wpm</b>. In total ten tests were conducted with approximately one day in between each test with normal computer use.&quot;</i><p>

<p>XPeRT Keyboard is an innovative new piece of software that will not only allow experienced typists to type faster, but allow those new to keyboarding to reach touch typing speeds in record time. XPeRT Keyboard remaps the keyboard layout eliminating the standard QWERTY layout found on most keyboards.</p>

<p>The QWERTY key layout was originally conceived back in the 1870's and was actually designed to slow typing speeds to eliminate key jamming issues. Commonly used keys are placed in some of the most inconvenient locations in the keyboard layout. XPeRT Keyboard fixes this, optimizing key location, without changing things so much that a adept QWERTY typist cannot make the change over. In fact an experienced (hunt & peck) QWERTY typist can change over to XPeRT and see improvements in speed in as little as two hours. More statistics are available at http://www.xpertkeyboard.com.</p>

<p>Not everyone has a keyboard with removable caps, so XPeRT Keyboard offers key labels with the software. In giving this new layout a try, I must say I was quite impressed. Being a long time user of QWERTY, the new system felt a little uncomfortable at first, as expected. After an hour or so I had a more natural feel for the XPeRT system and could type comfortably on it, perhaps more comfortably than the QWERTY setup. I did notice that there were less finger straining maneuvers than QWERTY where typing a "p" before a period usually resulted in an error.</p>

<p>XPeRT Keyboard is an interesting piece of software with true potential to improve everybody's typing efficiency. I really encourage computer users to give this a try for (a while) to truly see the advantage to the XPeRT system.

<p>I have known for some time that the standard computer, typewriter and word processor keyboard was based on a design that originates in the 1800's. I know that the design was specifically laid out so as to slow the workers down to keep from jamming the machines. What I did not appreciate was how much of a hindrance this layout was. I have a typing speed of around 49 WPM on a standard QWERTY layout, on a good day. But I have always had problems at certain times when typing when it just feels like my hands are fighting themselves to get the letters out correctly. I am sure this contributes significantly to any errors I make when typing. 

<p>The most difficult part of using this program was breaking the habit of touch-typing that I have been doing for a number of years. But after the oddness of the key layout started to wear off, I did notice immediately that I did not have the same feeling of tension that characterized typing for me traditionally. The change in key positions was a significant change, but is just a habit to get over for a touch-typist, for the hunt-and-peck typist, this would not be a big problem. The new key layout did indeed make the entire process easier and faster. For myself I also noticed that my hands were not as tired as they normally would be after doing a stretch of writing. </p>

<p>In a test type, I was able to do average of <b><i>49 WPM </b></i>with one error, after a week with this program I was up to an average of<b><i> 77 WPM </b></i>and no errors. <b><i>Every now and then I think of what my typing was like and have to admit this would not be something I could have easily believed if I had been told it.</i></b> The limitation of this kind of training will be how you will make use of it. If you work in an office and the keyboard is not yours, then it is unlikely they will want you to remap the keys to accomodate the different layout. For someone that works at home, this will be the easiest to integrate into your skills. <b><i>Mind you, anyone that can show their employer or IT department the improvement in speed and accuracy that you get with this layout, might have a good chance of getting it changed.</b></i> </p>

</p>The QWERTY keyboard layout was a necessary evil in the 19th century, we are in the 21st century now though and I would have to say it is time for a change. </p>
