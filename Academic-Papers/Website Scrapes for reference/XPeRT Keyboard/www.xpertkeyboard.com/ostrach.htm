<font size=1>Excerpts from a past web article: <b>"Typing Speed: How Fast is Average</b>, 4,000 typing scores statistically analyzed and interpreted". By Teresia R. Ostrach, President, Five Star Staffing, Inc., Orlando, FL.<br>

<i>"... everybody knows what an average typist is, right? Somebody who types between 50 and 60 WPM? Well, isn't it? Well, NO, it's not!"______"...Dr. Alan Lloyd ... said, "Less than half the population of the world has the manual dexterity to wiggle their fingers at the speed of 50 words per minute or better."______"... I realized that my company had computerized records on more than 4,000 typing tests taken over a four year period. ... we had used the same test in our office under the same conditions day after day"</i><br><br>
