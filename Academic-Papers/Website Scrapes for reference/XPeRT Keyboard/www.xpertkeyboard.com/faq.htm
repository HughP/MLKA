<h5>Q1: ... Is XPeRT available on a keyboard hardware device?</h5>

<p>At present the <b><em>XPeRT Keyboard&trade;</em></b> is only available as a software download and hardware conversion &ldquo;kit&rdquo;. Moving keycaps should be a &ldquo;Snap&rdquo;! (Some hardware versions would still require accompanying software. It is far easier to change a software keyboard file than reprogram a keyboard microchip). Key cap conversion should take only about 3 to 5 minutes. Permanent Key Labels are available, if you don't want to move key caps at all. (see the 
<a href="purchase.htm" target="right">Purchasing</a> page for more info) ...

<h5>Q2: ... Is XPeRT of benefit to touch typists?</h5>

<p>That depends on typing speed. If you are truly exceptional and already typing at over 60 wpm, there may not be a great advantage in switching to XPeRT. Keep in mind, though, that average touch typing speed is only around 40 wpm. (
       <a href="ostrach.htm" target="right">Reference</a>). 

<p><b>Try a keyboard speed test.</b>  Type for 10 minutes and get an automatic word count using the MSWord, File, Properties (or Summary Info), Statistics function. Divide by 10 to get words per minute (wpm). OR: ........ Use the <a href="typetest.htm" target="right"><font color=#0A446B><b>On-line Typing Speed Test</b></font></a> at our site. Benchmark speed on the standard Qwerty keyboard for comparison, then test speed on the XPeRT Keyboard after two weeks of regular use. </p> 

<p>For touch typists in the 25 to 40 wpm range, there is probably room for some significant improvement using the <b><i>XPeRT Keyboard</i></b>, with a little effort. You could be able to type at over 60 wpm with the right keyboard! ... <a href="#top">return to top</a></p>

<h5>Q3: ... How do you set XPeRT as the default keyboard on Windows XP?</h5>

<p>After running the XPeRT Setup program, activate by:<br>
o Selecting: Start -->  Settings --> Control Panel --> Regional, International Languages<br>
 o In the Languages page, go to <b>"Details"</b>. Add XPeRT from the bottom of the drop down menu; Apply<br>
o Return to the Languages page. Click the arrow on the right of top window - XPeRT is now an option. Click it to highlight and select as the default<br><br>

Note that The Standard / Qwerty keyboard remains available.  To select Qwerty within an application, use the keyboard icon (tiny keyboard or EN) on taskbar at the bottom right of the screen. ... <a href="#top">return to top</a>

<h5>Q4: ... I deleted my Setup program. How do I re-Install XPeRT?</h5>

<p>First, did you actually Uninstall XPeRT? If not, it still resides as a Windows Language option, which can be accessed using Control Panel, Keyboard, Language utilities.  For details see the <b><i>XPeRT Guide.</i></b></p>

<p>Generally, there is no need to delete the XPeRT Setup program or remove the XPeRT Keyboard from your system files. The Standard / Qwerty layout can be restored at any time using Windows Keyboard / Language uitlities. XPeRT can reside as a background Language option.  If you do Uninstall XPeRT <b>and</b> have deleted the XPeRT Setup program as well, there is a solution:</p>

<p>Purchasing records can be used to determine that you are a registered  <b><em>XPeRT Keyboard&trade;</em></b> license holder.  Just send an email to: <a href="mailto:matrixmail@telus.net"> matrixmail@telus.net</a>, requesting a replacement copy. Include your name, e-mail address, date of purchase (approximate date is better than none) and country or state or province. ... <a href="#top">return to top</a></p>
