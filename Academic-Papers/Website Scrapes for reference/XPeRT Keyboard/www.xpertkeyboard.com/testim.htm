<tr>
 <td align="center"><i>.<br>.... After buying a new computer, I'm glad to have the XPeRT Keyboard back; it is so much easier to use.... </i>

 <td align="center">.<br><b><i>.... Definitely can see the product would increase typing speed and perhaps accuracy and I only do moderate amounts of typing .... </i></b>

<tr>
    <td align="center"><b><i> .... So much for my touch typing - It's so slow - I had no idea. Lucky thing I found out about XPeRT ....</i></b>

     <td align="center"><i> .... The [XPeRT] keyboard is so easy to use that I would never go back to the awkward Qwerty layout. XPeRT is so intuitive.  The important keys, like A & E, are where you think they should be, just right of center. .... </i>

<tr>
  <td align="center"><i> .... It took me the longest time to get around to installing the XPeRT Keyboard. It seemed I was always too busy. Now that XPeRT is installed, my typing speed has really accelerated. Maybe I'll be less busy! ....</i>

  <td align="center"><b><i> .... Installing a new keyboard layout made me nervous. What if the software was confusing? What if it took a long time to move the key caps? What if I didn't like it, afterall? Well, none of those things happened. It was easy to install and I love it. ...</i></b>

<tr>
  <td align="center"><b><i> .... The keycaps on my PC keyboard were at slightly different heights on different rows. Moving letters around looked just a bit odd, but it didn't cause any problems when typing ....</i></b>

  <td align="center"><i>.... On my laptop the key caps popped off and snapped back on without a problem. The new keyboard looks just like the old one, except for the "XPeRT" in the top left corner. Letters are in friendlier places too of course ... </i>

<tr>

      <td align="center"><i>.... The keyboard installed itself from the e-mail attachment.  Wow, even I got it the first time around. .... </i>

 <td align="center"><b><i> .... The XPeRT Keyboard has the potential to revolutionize PC input ....</i></b>

<tr>
  <td align="center"><b><i> .... Sometimes other people need to use my PC, like grandkids or visitors. It's really handy to be able to switch back over to the standard keyboard without shutting down the PC ....</i></b>

 <td align="center"><i> .... It's curious that resistance to change can be so strong, even when the benefits are enormous.  That must be why the world is using a totally obsolete and inefficient keyboard like Qwerty ....</i>
