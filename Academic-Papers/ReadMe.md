#Academic Fit
_As previously indicated, the activity of typing is encountered by a variety of academic disciplines. I divide these into two discussions segments_: _Language Use_ and _Human-Computer Interaction._

##Langauge Use
Under the auspices of the term _language use_, I classify studies in linguistics (theoretical), linguistic anthropology, language use in digital mediums, language description, language development, language documentation, language revitalization, language learning, language teaching, literacy, and sociolinguistics. The answer to the question: _which discipline deals most closely with the task of language use in the text input task of typing_, is _Yes_. That is, they can and all do have interactions in journals which deal with the text input task.  Various disciplines also have other kinds of relevant discussions like: orthography development, font development, calligraphy, or graphemics.

###Terms
We distinguish _language documentation_ as a separate activity from _language description_ following ideas presented here:
* Himmelmann, Nikolaus P. 1998. Documentary and Descriptive Linguistics. Linguistics 36.1: 161-95.
* Woodbury, Anthony C. 2003. Defining Documentary Linguistics In Peter K. Austin (ed.), Language Documentation and Description, vol. 1, 35-51. London: SOAS.
* Woodbury, Anthony C. 2011. Language documentation. In Julia Sallabank Peter K. Austin (ed.), The Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages (Cambridge Handbooks in Language and Linguistics), 159-86. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

We distinguish _language development_ as a separate activity from _language documentation_ following ideas presented here:
* Ferguson, Charles Albert. 1968. Language development. In Joshua A. Fishman, Charles Albert Ferguson & Jyotirindra Das Gupta (eds.), Language problems of developing nations, 27-35. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
* Simons, Gary F. 2011. On defining language development. Poster presented at 2nd International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation, University of Hawaii, 11â€“13 February 2011.

We distinguish _language revitalization/conservation_ as a separate activity from _language documentation_, and/or _language description_ following ideas presented here:
* Boerger, Brenda. 2011. To BOLDly Go Where No One Has Gone Before. Language Documentation & Conservation. 5: 208-233. http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4499

We hold that the text input activity is important in all of these disciplines.

##Human-Computer Interaction
Moving from broad categorization to more specific categorization, the taxonomy falls a bit like this: Human-Computer Interaction --> Input via Sensors --> Input target is Text --> Text Input --> Typing --> Keyboard Typing.

Some have attempted to categorize the various kinds of text input. One such attempt is by Poika Isokoski in his thesis [_A Minimal Device-Independent Text Input Method_](http://www.sis.uta.fi/~pi52316/g/node6.html). The following figure comes from section 3.1.

Thistaxonomy is somewhat aged and it is perhaps clearer to think about text input in terms of which sensors are used to acomplsih the text input.

* Compatible input devices
* Mouse
* Touchpads, touch-screens, pressure sensitive pens and digitizing tablets
* Trackball
* Joysticks
* Keyboard
