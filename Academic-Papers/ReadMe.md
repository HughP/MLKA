#Academic Fit
_As previously indicated, the activity of typing is encountered by a variety of academic disciplines. I divide these into two discussions segments_: _Language Use_ and _Human-Computer Interaction._

##Language Use
Under the auspices of the term _language use_, I classify studies in linguistics (theoretical), linguistic anthropology, language use in digital mediums, language description, language development, language documentation, language revitalization, language learning, language teaching, literacy, and sociolinguistics. The answer to the question: _which discipline deals most closely with the task of language use in the text input task of typing_, is _Yes_. That is, they can and all do have interactions in journals which deal with the text input task.  Various disciplines also have other kinds of relevant discussions like: orthography development, font development, calligraphy, or graphemics.

###Terms
We distinguish _language documentation_ as a separate activity from _language description_ following ideas presented here:
* Himmelmann, Nikolaus P. 1998. Documentary and Descriptive Linguistics. Linguistics 36.1: 161-95.
* Woodbury, Anthony C. 2003. Defining Documentary Linguistics In Peter K. Austin (ed.), Language Documentation and Description, vol. 1, 35-51. London: SOAS.
* Woodbury, Anthony C. 2011. Language documentation. In Julia Sallabank Peter K. Austin (ed.), The Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages (Cambridge Handbooks in Language and Linguistics), 159-86. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

We distinguish _language development_ as a separate activity from _language documentation_ following ideas presented here:
* Ferguson, Charles Albert. 1968. Language development. In Joshua A. Fishman, Charles Albert Ferguson & Jyotirindra Das Gupta (eds.), Language problems of developing nations, 27-35. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
* Simons, Gary F. 2011. On defining language development. Poster presented at 2nd International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation, University of Hawaii, 11–13 February 2011.

We distinguish _language revitalization/conservation_ as a separate activity from _language documentation_, and/or _language description_ following ideas presented here:
* Boerger, Brenda. 2011. To BOLDly Go Where No One Has Gone Before. Language Documentation & Conservation. 5: 208-233. http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4499

We hold that the text input activity is important in all of these disciplines.

###Sociology
We are not alone in considering the text input solution as being important to the use of minority languages. The following are some articles about text input from newspapers and gerally oriented media outlets.

* Washington Post: [How the Internet is killing the world’s languages](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/12/04/how-the-internet-is-killing-the-worlds-languages/?wprss=rss_homepage)
* BBC: [Will e-publishing help Africa switch on to reading?](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-25141849)
* The Language Documentation Crowd: [Digital Technology and Endangered Languages](http://www.thelanguagedocumentationcrowd.org/blog/2013/12/9/digital-technology-and-endangered-languages)
* The Wall Street Journal: [Smartphones Are Reinventing—And Ditching—the Keyboard](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324392804578358551800617098)

####Digtal content on the web
* [Digital Language Death](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077056) Academic article - _Of the approximately 7,000 languages spoken today, some 2,500 are generally considered endangered. Here we argue that this consensus figure vastly underestimates the danger of digital language death, in that less than 5% of all languages can still ascend to the digital realm. We present evidence of a massive die-off caused by the digital divide._



###Typing is Language production
There exists an interesting question, which goes like the following: _Is typing acually language production?_

I hold that it is langauge production. 
I also hold that typing is communicative gesture. Some hold that gesture is communicative without being language, making exceptions for sign-languages. I hold that typing is language use, and therefore language, and also simultaniously communictive gesture, in ways more like sign-language than like non-communicative gesture.

##Human-Computer Interaction
Moving from broad categorization to more specific categorization, the taxonomy falls a bit like this: Human-Computer Interaction -- > Input via Sensors --> Input target is Text --> Text Input --> Typing --> Keyboard Typing.

Some have attempted to categorize the various kinds of text input. One such attempt is by Poika Isokoski in his thesis [_A Minimal Device-Independent Text Input Method_](http://www.sis.uta.fi/~pi52316/g/node6.html). The following figure comes from section 3.1.

This taxonomy is somewhat aged and it is perhaps clearer to think about text input in terms of which sensors are used to accomplish the text input.

![Text input Sensors](/Academic-Papers/images/Text-input-via-sensors.jpg)

* Compatible input devices
* Mouse
* Touchpads, touch-screens, pressure sensitive pens and digitizing tablets
* Trackball
* Joysticks
* Keyboard
