#Theory
_I find there to be four teoretical topics which seem to be apropiate to disucs in this section. These include the following:_

##Typewriter Histoy
This is where "factual" history of machines are discussed and citations are stored. Much of what we are trying to imporve upon is because of historical onomilies.

##Keyboard layout Theory
This is the theory which applies to what should go where on a keyboard layout. This theory motivates methodologies. That is, because we hold things to be true in our theory we count numbers and actions a certain way.

##Information Theory
This theory talks about how infomration is processed. This section also contains discussions about the congnitive processes in typing.

##Object Anthropology
This theory talks about how humans interact with objects. Objects like the keyboard.
