#Theory
_I find there to be four teoretical topics which seem to be apropiate to disucs in this section. These include the following:_

1. [`/Typewriter-Histoy`](/Typewriter-Histoy)
2. [`/Keyboard-Layout-Theory`](/Keyboard-Layout-Theory)


##Typewriter Histoy
This is where "factual" history of machines are discussed and citations are stored. Much of what we are trying to imporve upon is because of historical onomilies. [`/Typewriter-Histoy`](/Typewriter-Histoy)

##Keyboard Layout Theory
This is the theory which applies to what should go where on a keyboard layout. This theory motivates methodologies. That is, because we hold things to be true in our theory we count numbers and actions a certain way. [`/Keyboard-Layout-Theory`](/Keyboard-Layout-Theory)


##Information Theory
This theory talks about how infomration is processed. This section also contains discussions about the congnitive processes in typing.
[`/Information-Theory`](/Information-Theory)

###Fitts' Law
The work of several people fit in this section. But primarily the work of Fitts.


###Cognitive aspects of typing
_There are two resourcs which fit here:_
* The various works of [Saul Sternberg](http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~saul/)
* The work of William E. Cooper:
 * Cooper, William E. (ed.) 1983. Cognitive Aspects of Skilled Typewriting. New York, Heidelberg, Berlin: Springer-Verlag. 


##Object Anthropology
This theory talks about how humans interact with objects. Objects like the keyboard.
