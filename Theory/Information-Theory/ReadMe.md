#Information theory
Fitts law pits speed and accuracy against each other in performance. This is often used in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) experiments, including text input tasks like typing.

Fundamentally there are two measurements, _distance_ and _speed_. These measurement are made complex through the error rate measurement. However, speed and distance have previously always been presented as related to each other. That is speed is a measure of time over distance traveled. I am proposing that this could be modified so that speed and distance are independent variables based on the conceptual categories in the users' mind. So, while there is a "real" typing speed which is measurable with components of time and distance, there is a second factor which is the perceived time it takes to accomplish a text input task. Let me illustrate with an example. Suppose we were at in a valley and we needed to cross a tall mountain to get to an adjacent parallel valley. We could choose one of three options we could: walk a dirt path, we could drive a Toyota Corolla over a pot hole filled road, or we could board a helicopter and fly. Now depending on which mode of transport we normally take we might assume that the next valley is a "certain distance" away. But really our perception of distance is embedded in our perception of travel method. If we normally walk an this walk generally takes 18 hours, then we will attribute the walk to a perceptual distance of 18. If we normally fly and it take 1 hour to fly then we might attribute this distance to a value of 1. The use of the Toyota Corolla might be a painful compromise if we are used to flying, because our perception of distance increases as we move from a fast rate of speed to a slow rate of speed.
