##Applications related keyboard analysis
_This section includes mostly a description of software used in various keyboard layout experiments. It also includes where possible a copy of the software and a link to where it was originally located._

##Metrics of keyboard analysis
_This section considers the physical measurement of keyboards and the metrics of analysing user behavior with those keybaord layouts._
###Keyboard key centers
###Keyboard angle

* character codes
* encoded characters
* Keyboard key press pressure
* Key size
* key spacing
* keyboard tilt
* visual characters on the key
