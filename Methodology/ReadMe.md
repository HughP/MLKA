#Methodology
_This section (or folder) discusses and contains the tools used in this project and other porjects in the assement of the keyboard arangement problem._

##Software and Applications
The folder Software and applications used contains software used to obtain the results in this project.
It is further devided up into three sections:

1. Software used
  * Project code created - [Issues in Programming](/Methodology/PythonHelps.md)
  * Project code borrowed

2. Software stashed
3. Software reviewed or links to other software solutions


###Applications related keyboard analysis
_This section includes mostly a description of software used in various keyboard layout experiments. It also includes where possible a copy of the software and a link to where it was originally located._
[As a subsection here](/Methodology/applications-and-programs/ReferencesAndLinks.md)

##Metrics and Measurements
###Metrics of keyboard analysis
_This section considers the physical measurement of keyboards and the metrics of analysing user behavior with those keybaord layouts._

####Keyboard key centers
* The distance between key centers is called pitch. Generally this is considered 19mm. All of my apple keyboards maintain this distance. More resources:

 * http://web.archive.org/web/20090630115240/http://www.technewsworld.com/story/67444.html

It is reported in the Grey Literature that this 19mm distance is a sacred rule. 

Key centers are important for computing distance.

####Measuring finger plunge
The plunge (this might sometimes be called the "stroke", "action travel" or just "action") that a key takes is supposed to be between 2mm and 4mm 
* ISO 9241-4 says "The key displacement shall be between 1,5mm and 6,0mm. The preferred key displacement should be between 2,0mm and 4,0mm." The ISO key travel recommendations seem to be derived from a 1969 paper that recommended travel between 0.05 inches (1.3mm) and 0.25 inches (6.4mm): Kinkead, R. and B. Gonzales, Human Factors Design Recommendations for Touch-operated Keyboards. Final Report (Document 12091-FR), Minneapolis Honeywell, Inc., 1969.
