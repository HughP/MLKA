#Methodology
_This section (or folder) discusses and contains the tools used in this project and other porjects in the assement of the keyboard arangement problem._

##Software and Applications
The folder Software and applications used contains software used to obtain the results in this project.
It is further devided up into three sections:

1. Software used
  * Project code created - [Issues in Programming](/Methodology/PythonHelps.md)
  * Project code borrowed

2. Software stashed
3. Software reviewed or links to other software solutions


###Applications related keyboard analysis
_This section includes mostly a description of software used in various keyboard layout experiments. It also includes where possible a copy of the software and a link to where it was originally located._
[As a subsection here](/applications-and-programs/ReferencesAndLinks.md)

##Metrics and Measurements
###Metrics of keyboard analysis
_This section considers the physical measurement of keyboards and the metrics of analysing user behavior with those keybaord layouts._

####Keyboard key centers

##Keyboard composition
* Hardware controller codes
* keycodes
* character codes
* encoded characters
* Keyboard key press pressure
* Key size
* key spacing
* keyboard tilt
* visual characters on the key
 * See: The Design of Keyboard Templates http://pro.sagepub.com/content/35/6/486.short
* Keyboard layout (arrangement of characters on the keyboard)
* Number of keys on the keyboard (ISO vs. ANSI vs. JIS)
