#Applications and Programs
_This is a list of applications and programs used accross the history of this text input analysis project. The list contains several parts based on the kind of software.


##Text processing and counting
_Many of the texts recived needed for one reason or another to be cleaned up or to have the values of the texts transposed into other values._
This list of software contains the software I used to do this.

Within this section there are several home-made or custom scripts these are outlined in the readme.md of the [`Text processing and counting`](/Methodology/applications-and-programs/Text-processing-and-counting)folder.

##Fonts and diagram creating tools
More deatils in the ReadMe.md of the [`Fonts and diagram creating tools`](/Methodology/applications-and-programs/Fonts-and-diagram-creating-tools) folder

##Keyboard layout analysis
_These are tools which take keyboard layouts in some manner and then do some sort of analysis on them._

The Keyboard layout analsis software is divided up into three basic parts:_
 1. Software used or developed in the process of this research.
 2. Software encountered in this research and "stashed" here.
 3. Other software resources.
 4. I'll think of something else to put here... [in Germanic languages things sound better in threes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing))
 
 
###Software used and developed

_Short explanation about each software piece stashed here and how it is used._

I have stashed Six sets of software related to keyboard layout optimization. These are as follows:

1. The [Carpalx software](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/) written in perl.
2. Michael Dickens optimizer titled [_Typing_](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) written in C.
3. Patrick Gillespie's [Keyboard Layout Analyzer](https://github.com/patorjk/keyboard-layout-analyzer) written in JavaScript.
4. Michael Capewell's [Keyboard Evolve application](http://keyboardevolve.sourceforge.net/) written in C++. [Explained here](http://www.michaelcapewell.com/programming/keyboardevolve.htm)
5. Patrick Wied's [Keyboard Heatmap](https://github.com/pa7/Keyboard-Heatmap) written in JavaScript.
6. [Software used in the creation](http://bepo.fr/wiki/) and analysis of Bépo, an optimized Keyboard for French.

As is explained in the section on theory, each of these tools uses a different algorithm for determining the keyboard layout arrangement. None of them (save perhaps Bépo) work with combining diacritics, or diacritics at all.

Due to linkrot one online keyboard analysis tool from a .uk domain (written in .NET) was not avaible. Images of this tool are in the internet archive, but the server side features are not preserved.
 
####Software developed
 _This is software and scripts I have developed._
 
###Software stashed
_Software I have found but am not sure how it works or what it does._
