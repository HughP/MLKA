#Applications and Programs
_This is a list of applications and programs used with text input. The list is divided up into three basic parts:_
 1. Software used or developed in the process of this research.
 2. Software encountered in this research and "stashed" here.
 3. Other software resources.
 4. I'll think of something else to put here... [in Germanic languages things sound better in threes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing))

I have stashed four pieces of software related to keyboard layout optimization. These are as follows:

1. The Parpalx software written in perl.
2. Michael Dickens optimizer titled [_Typing_](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) written in C.
3. Patrick Gillespie's [Keyboard Layout Analyzer](https://github.com/patorjk/keyboard-layout-analyzer) written in JavaScript.
