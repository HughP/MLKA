#Applications and Programs
_This is a list of applications and programs used with text input. The list is divided up into three basic parts:_
 1. Software used or developed in the process of this research.
 2. Software encountered in this research and "stashed" here.
 3. Other software resources.
 4. I'll think of something else to put here... [in Germanic languages things sound better in threes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing))

 ###Software developed
 _This is software and scripts I have developed._
 
 ##Software stashed
 _Short explanation about each software piece stashed here and how it is used._

I have stashed Six sets of software related to keyboard layout optimization. These are as follows:

1. The [Carpalx software](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/) written in perl.
2. Michael Dickens optimizer titled [_Typing_](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing) written in C.
3. Patrick Gillespie's [Keyboard Layout Analyzer](https://github.com/patorjk/keyboard-layout-analyzer) written in JavaScript.
4. Michael Capewell's [Keyboard Evolve application](http://keyboardevolve.sourceforge.net/) written in C++.
5. Patrick Wied's [Keyboard Heatmap](https://github.com/pa7/Keyboard-Heatmap) written in JavaScript.
6. [Software used in the creation](http://bepo.fr/wiki/) and analysis of Bépo, an optimized Keyboard for French.

As is explained in the section on theory, each of these tools uses a different algorithm for determining the keyboard layout arrangement. None of them (save perhaps Bépo) work with combining diacritics, or diacritics at all.

Due to linkrot one online keyboard analysis tool from a .uk domain (written in .NET) was not avaible. Images of this tool are in the internet archive, but the server side features are not preserved.
