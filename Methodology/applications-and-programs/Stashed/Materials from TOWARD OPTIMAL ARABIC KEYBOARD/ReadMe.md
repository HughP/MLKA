>Dear sirs, 
>
>i was recently reading the article: TOWARD OPTIMAL ARABIC KEYBOARD LAYOUT USING GENETIC ALGORITHM
>
>I noticed in your procedures section that you have three bits of customized code. I am wondering if this code might be available still.
>
>What I understand from your article is that there were:
>
>1. some Regular expressions for cleaning up the data (removing the wikitext)
>2. some sort of sting identifier for matching the order of characters
>3. some sort of program which implemented the genetic algorithm and fitness assumptions
>
>
>Basically I would like to replicate your experiment and then also do it with other languages, for instance Persian, Urdu, or Hausa.

>thank you,

>Dear Hugh,
>
>Thank you for your interest in our work. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) code of this paper is implemented and customized for the Octave software version of that time. It would be much better to implement this work using one of the available powerful GA tools, such as MATLAB's Global Optimization Toolbox. 
>Evaluating the fitness function is the key part in using GA. Please find attached the files of the used fitness function evaluation in our paper. I hope you find them useful in preparing your implementation. You can find sufficient details about the algorithm in our paper and the closely related references.
