README

This is TECkit, a library for encoding conversion, usable through standalone
tools or by linking with other software packages.

See the Documentation folder for information on the TECkit mapping language
and conversion tool usage notes.

The teckit_compile tool now supports a new option, not described in the PDF
documentation:

    -x    generate XML representation rather than compiled table

This is primarily intended for use by the Reprise utility, and the XML format
produced is subject to change according to the needs of that tool.

The TECkit libraries were updated in April 2008 to support the Unicode 5.1
character repertoire; the documentation and tools (Mapping Editor, DropTEC
text file converter, command-line utilities) have not been modified from the
previous (2006) release.
