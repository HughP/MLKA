##Multi-Lingual Keyboard Assessment
_This repo contains some code and some theory for the assessment and comparison of keyboards in multiple languages. The multi lingual nature of the perspective in this repo sets it apart from many other projects._

####About
This gihub repository contains scripts, discussion and overview of keyboards and keyboard layout solutions, formulas and data used in papers, presentations (papers presented), authored or co-authored by Hugh Paterson III on the topic of User Experience in text input form minority languages. This is part of an investigation which is a copmponent of Hugh's Masters in Linguistics.
The purpose of this work is to present research and rasise questions about the keyboard layout desing presented to minorty language users of text input solutions. It is my hope to make the text input process easier for languages which are discriminated against by technological norms.

####License and contributions
In one sense this is "not traditional open source" in that I (Hugh) am not licensing the repo under the GPL or CC or other such license. However, I am attempting to work more openly and github is the best venue I have found for working openly. So, collaboration is possible, forking the repo is also possible, and comments and corrections are always welcome. However, until after the masters thesis is presented, pull requests will be reviewed with caution (but not necessarily outright rejected). this is simply because in the academic humanities it is important (at least for my institution) to have work independent of others, as such independence is the basis of "originality".
Also in contrast to the norms of open source licenses and collaboration practice this repo may contain cited works which are not Hugh's "invention". These will allways, where possible indicate who the original author/contributor is. This is more inline with the academic tradition of publishing rather than the open source tradition of nameless collaboration.

_This repo is divided up into several sections. It is hard to say content is soley belonging to one section or anther (so cross references may exist)._

##Keyboard layout theory and progression
_This section discusses the histroy of the evolution of the keyboard and the evolution of how keyboards are measured. Perhaps the best known discussion is the contraversy over QWERTY and Dvoak. Howerver there are more than these two layouts to be discussed._
_There are two major social locations where keyboard layouts are discussed:_
  1. The computer programing industry
  2. The professional academic literature

_A review of the websites discussing the problems encountered by the compute programing industry reveal very little about multi-lingual or non-English/Roman Script discussions. A review of the professional literature including techincal journals, and journals focused on ergonomis find that very little in the literature exists about keyboard efficiency measurements across languages. More generally in the academic literature the problem of what characters go where on a keyboard layout, that is how they are arranged, is discussed as the **Keyboard Arrangement Problem** (KAP) or **General Keyboard Arrangement Problem** (GKAP)._

##Academic fit
The Academic fit for keyboard layout assessment is difficult to pin to a single academic discipline. It has been apporached from the perspective of _anthropology of objects, applied mathmatics, computer science, design, economics, egronomics, language development, language documentation, linguistics, literacy, user expereince design_. In this project I take three academic perspectives: 
 1. linguistics
 2. language development
 3. text input

##Keyboard composition
* Hardware controler codes
* keycodes
* character codes
* encoded characters
* Keyboard key press pressure
* Key size
* key spacing
* keyboard tilt
* visual characters on the key
* Keyboard layout (arangement of characters on the keyobard)
* Number of keys on the keyboard (ISO vs. ANSI vs. JIS)
