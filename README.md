Multi-Lingual Keyboard Assessment

_This repo contains some code and some theory for the assessment and comparison of keyboards in multiple languages. The multi lingual nature of the perspective in this repo sets it apart from many other projects. There are two major social locations where keyboard layouts are discussed:_
  1. The computer programing industry
  2. The professional academic literature

_A review of the websites discussing the problems encountered by the compute programing industry reveal very little about multi-lingual or non-English/Roman Script discussions. A review of the professional literature including techincal journals, and journals focused on ergonomis find that very little in the literature exists about keyboard efficiency measurements across languages. More generally in the academic literature the problem of what characters go where on a keyboard layout, that is how they are arranged, is discussed as the **Keyboard Arrangement Problem** (KAP) or **General Keyboard Arrangement Problem** (GKAP)._

This repo is divided up into several sections. It is hard to say content is soley belonging to one section or anther (so cross references may exist).

##Keyboard layout theory and progression
_This section discusses the histroy of the evolution of the keyboard and the evolution of how keyboards are measured. Perhaps the best known discussion is the contraversy over QWERTY and Dvoak. Howerver there are more than these two layouts to be discussed._

##Keyboard composition
* Hardware controler codes
* keycodes
* character codes
* encoded characters
* Keyboard key press pressure
* Key size
* key spacing
* keyboard tilt
* visual characters on the key
* Keyboard layout (arangement of characters on the keyobard)
* Number of keys on the keyboard (ISO vs. ANSI vs. JIS)
