Multi-Lingual Keyboard Assessment
_This repo contains some code and some theory for the assessment and comparison of keyboards in multiple languages. I find that very little in the literature exists about keyboard effiencnetcy measurements across languages. More generally the problem of what characters go where are arranged discussed as the **Keyboard Arrangement Problem** (KAP) or **General Keyboard Arrangement Problem** (GKAP)._

This repo is divided up into several sections.
