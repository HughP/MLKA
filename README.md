##Multi-Lingual Keyboard Assessment
_This gihub repository contains scripts, discussion and overview of keyboards and keyboard layout solutions, formulas and data used in papers, presentations (papers presented), authored or co-authored by Hugh Paterson III on the topic of User Experience in text input form minority languages. In one sense this is "not traditional open source" in that I am licensing the repo under the GPL or CC. However, I am trying to work more openly and this is the best venue I have found for that. So, Collaboration is possible, forking is also possible, and comments are always welcome (pull requests will be reviewed). The purpose of this work is to present research and rasise questions about the keyboard layout desing presented to minorty language users of text input solutions. It is my hope to make the text input process easier for languages which are discriminated against by technological norms._
_This repo contains some code and some theory for the assessment and comparison of keyboards in multiple languages. The multi lingual nature of the perspective in this repo sets it apart from many other projects._

_This repo is divided up into several sections. It is hard to say content is soley belonging to one section or anther (so cross references may exist)._

##Keyboard layout theory and progression
_This section discusses the histroy of the evolution of the keyboard and the evolution of how keyboards are measured. Perhaps the best known discussion is the contraversy over QWERTY and Dvoak. Howerver there are more than these two layouts to be discussed._
_There are two major social locations where keyboard layouts are discussed:_
  1. The computer programing industry
  2. The professional academic literature

_A review of the websites discussing the problems encountered by the compute programing industry reveal very little about multi-lingual or non-English/Roman Script discussions. A review of the professional literature including techincal journals, and journals focused on ergonomis find that very little in the literature exists about keyboard efficiency measurements across languages. More generally in the academic literature the problem of what characters go where on a keyboard layout, that is how they are arranged, is discussed as the **Keyboard Arrangement Problem** (KAP) or **General Keyboard Arrangement Problem** (GKAP)._

##Keyboard composition
* Hardware controler codes
* keycodes
* character codes
* encoded characters
* Keyboard key press pressure
* Key size
* key spacing
* keyboard tilt
* visual characters on the key
* Keyboard layout (arangement of characters on the keyobard)
* Number of keys on the keyboard (ISO vs. ANSI vs. JIS)
