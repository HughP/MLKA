#Stats to evaluate the typing activity

Michael Dickens uses the following metrics (See [fitness.txt](https://github.com/michaeldickens/Typing/blob/master/doc/Fitness) for more clarification):
* Hands: for balance 
* Fingers: for finger load
* Fitness: ???
* Distance: ???
* Finger work: ???
* Inward Rolls: Where the first key hit is on the outside of the keyboard but the second key hit is on the inside (These key need not be concurrently located but must occur in the same row.)
* Outward Rolls: Where the first key hit is on the inside of the keyboard but the second key hit is on the outside (These key need not be concurrently located but must occur in the same row.)
* Same hand: Is a measurement where the same hand is is used to tap two consecutive keys
* Same finger: Is a measurement where the same finger is is used to tap two consecutive keys
* Row Change: ???
* Home Jump: Is a measurement where the home row is jumped, where the first key is either on the top or the bottom but then the home row is jumped and the top or bottom row is used next. ??? does this assume the same finger is used?
* Ring jump: ???
* To center: ???
* To outside: ???
